this is my run through of the hackrank challenge set '30 days of code' 
this is all my own code and i spend a lot of time teasing my brain to find my solutions to these beginner problems. 
this was also my first time coding in Java after working with javascript for many hours beforhand. it was a great way to dip my toes into the idea of being a programmer who can take on any language, i would reccomend the challange set to anyone trying to expand there number of comfortable coding languages!
